# Introduction

This project will contain the SW of the Ratibroombroom micromouse. The micromouse is based in the *STM32F405RGT6* microcontroller.

This is an open source project. That means you can build your own if you want. You can find the HW specification of this micromouse in this link (https://github.com/aindustriosa/Ratibroombroom)

# Developing
Please read [development](docs/developing.md)

# References

This project uses a fork of the mmlib library from Bulebots (Original project here: https://github.com/Bulebots/mmlib). Mmlib implements functionality for maze search and resolution, abstracting this funcitionality from the HW actually used.

This project is also inspired by the following projects:

* Bule bule micromouse: https://bulebule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ from Bulebots and its continuation, Meiga (https://github.com/Bulebots/meiga).
