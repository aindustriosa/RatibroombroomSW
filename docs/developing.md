# Development
There are several hackers developing this robot, so there are N ways to develop it :P.

If you want to compile from the host read [development from host](developing_from_host.md)

If you want to compile from a Docker image read [development from Docker](developing_from_docker.md)

We have a setup to use VSCode that uses [remote containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers). [Here](developing_from_vscode.md) are some instructions for that.
